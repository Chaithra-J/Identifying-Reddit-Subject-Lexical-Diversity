## Identifying the subject of Reddit from its most commonly used words and finding the 3 lexical diversity of the subreddit
### Research Questions
It is commonplace to consider and base one’s opinion based on information consumed on the
internet. With an increase in social media platforms, there is an overwhelming amount of information
reaching people everyday and it is of great interest to marketing companies, data scientists, content
creators, linguists and researchers to understand the type of information that is drawing people’s attention
and sparking discussions on social media.
In this study, the focus was on an online discussion forum(Reddit). In this study, we analyze the
following problem:
### Can we identify the subject of a subreddit from its most common words? 
This study offers a systematic analysis of top 10 reddit posts with a large number of comments(ranging from around 900 to 9
comments) in the chosen four subreddits(r/worldnews, r/news, r/books, r/movies). To accomplish this task,
sample comments from four subreddit(r/worldnews, r/news, r/books, r/movies) were considered. Large
sample of posts and comments were used which were subjected to pre-processing steps, tokenization,
finding common words, lexical diversity and building tagged corporas using Part Of Speech(POS) tags. In
addition, the study also attempts to identify the subject of the subreddit with the help of common words and
a frequency distribution plot.
